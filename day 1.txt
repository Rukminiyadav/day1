                                 OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION ON JAVASCRIPT
                                 
Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, bool
ean, etc). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

    Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

        The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
                        ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

        The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:
                       delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;
    Example:
           lets create an Object named my car and give iths properties 
           var mycar= new object();

        Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation . Objects are sometimes       called associative arrays.

     JavaScript Object with Constructor
        Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same.


     Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.
